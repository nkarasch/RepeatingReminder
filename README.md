# RepeatingReminder
A simple Android 4.0+ application modeled after the Lollipop DeskClock. Allows the user to schedule multiple unique notifications to repeatedly fire at specific intervals, on selected days of the week, and within chosen time ranges.  

This is useful for actions that need to be performed throughout long portions of the day. Taking a break from the computer every hour or taking the dog for a walk every three hours are perfect fits.

All of the icons and the functions for choosing the varying background color come from here. The interface was also the inspiration for this one.
