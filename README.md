# RepeatingReminders
A simple Android 4.1+ application modeled after the Lollipop DeskClock. Allows the user to schedule multiple unique notifications to repeatedly fire at specific intervals, on selected days of the week, and within chosen time ranges.  

This is useful for actions that need to be performed throughout the day. Things like taking a break from the computer every hour or taking the dog for a walk every three hours are the intended use case. Feel free to share any suggestions or problems.
